# BAM_V0 - Full Stack Business Administration Solution


## Introduction
This is a hobby project, created by me `Rahman Rajon` or `Fahadur Rahman Joy` with a view to explore the basics of full stack web development with [Next.js](). This is a webapp with a standard of production level. It is developed by me alone.

## About the Project
`BAM` is `Business Administration` which is a full stack management solution for monitoring ins and outs of a medium sized business. It has been primarily designed for `Nazifa Traders & Jarif Electronics`, a medium sized showroom. The project is a `Sinensis Production`.

## Preview
Though this is built for using `in device`. Which means it is developed to run and use locally. Still you may find a preview version in [BAM_V0 Preview](https://bam-v0.vercel.app/). But as Mongodb is to be hosted locally it may not behave natural.

## What it Does
- Monitors all details incoming and outgoing products.
- Track customers whom the product was sold to.
- Calculate and show due over customers.
- Emails a digital recipt to the user and the admin whenever a action is made.
- Built in OTP service for enhancing security of user login
- The 'Kisti' can be managed from inside. 
- Payment Tracking with ease.
- General Employee Management with ease.


## General Features
- Uses Next and React.js
- Classic Minimal UI.
- Emailing Feature with Built  in Module (not third party libraries were used)
- OTP system is built without any third party module.
- Mongodb is used as DBMS. 
- Please not the system does not use Mongoose.

There a quite few modules, libraries and packages related to the project. You may find it in a more view in the `/learn` directory of the website.

## Please Note
Currently the website may behave rude cause it is developed to work locally, and during the development mongodb was hosted locally, and this is just a preview version, soon it will be developed at a good standard to make it more alive.

And no payment API is currently attatched with this project, we can hope soon (probably in the next version) direct payment (with bkash) would be attatched with it.


## Run it Locally

Run it directly 

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

It will be served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Just [Click Here To View](http://localhost:3000)
